## Other info
1. Some AVs can detect `run.exe` as a threat but it's not. (It is detected probably because It operates on processes)
2. If you are afraid that there's a virus inside `dll` or `exe` file, You can compile the source code on your own.
3. Remember to compile the source code in `Release x86` mode because Stronghold Crusader is `32 bit` appliaction.
4. Configs and `bot-dll.dll` have to be in the same directory as `run.exe`.

Have fun!
